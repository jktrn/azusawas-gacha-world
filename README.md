## Azusawa's Gacha World

### Difficulty: 1

### Description

Date: 03/02/2023

I am completely, utterly, unconditionally infatuated with Kohane Azusawa... it’s an unhealthy obsession. And today, her birthday banner just dropped.

I've topped out all my credit cards. I've cashed out on my index funds and sold my car. I've sacrificed my vitamins, my social life, my sanity—all for a glimpse of that sweet, sweet 「Happy Birthday！！2023 - こはね 小豆沢」limited birthday card. But alas, it's never enough. The odds are miniscule, the rates are rigged, the gacha system is a predatory sham. It feels like I've pulled a million times and I still haven't gotten her! Do the Gacha Gods not pity me?!
